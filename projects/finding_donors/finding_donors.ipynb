In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n","\n","In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n","\n",">**Note:** Please specify WHICH VERSION OF PYTHON you are using when submitting this notebook.

You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n","\n","The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-1wCmqOU7n-i"},"source":["----\n","## Exploring the Data\n","Run the code cell below to load necessary Python libraries and load the census data.

Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n","\n","|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n","| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n","| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n","| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n","| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n","\n","Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work.

Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n","\n","$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n","\n","In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n","\n","Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n","\n","\n","#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n","\n","** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n","\n","** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n","It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n","\n","`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n","\n","** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n","It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n","\n","`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n","\n","For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores.

For instance, it can be used to classify e-mails as spam / non-spam.\n","\n","Strengths\n","Gaussian Naive Bayes can deal with small training sets that have many features (e.g. text classification). The resulting model is very simplistic and can be trained quickly. It can deal well with datasets that have many features (high-dimensional datasets) due to its independence assumption.\n","\n","Weaknesses\n","Gaussian Naive Bayes does not work well if the train data are incomplete. If you have no occurrences of a class label and a certain attribute value together then the frequency-based probability estimate will be zero. Given Naive-Bayes' conditional independence assumption, when all the probabilities are multiplied you will get zero and this will affect the posterior probability estimate. Additionally, strongly correlating features might become an issue since Naive Bayes assumes independence of features. It also can’t learn interactions between features (e.g., it can’t learn that although you love movies with Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise, you hate movies where they’re together.\n","\n","What makes it a good candidate?\n","It could be a good candidate to solving the problem as the dataset has a lot of features (103) after the one-hot-encoding step.

That's why the SVM is able to solve problems which might not look like linearly separatable. Furthermore, SVM is defined by a convex optimization problem which does not have a local minimum.\n","\n","Weaknesses\n","Fitting the model can take a long time depending on how we choose our kernel parameters. Furthermore, picking the right kernel and its parameters is often quite hard. In a way the SVM moves the problem of overfitting from optimising the parameters to model selection.\n","More \"complex\" kernels (higher degree polynomials) are sensitive to overfitting.\n","Furthermore, SVMs are binary classifiers.
